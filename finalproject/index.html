       <h2>Einstein's Relativity</h2>
         <aside>  <img src="images/einstein.jpg"></aside> 
      
       <article> <p>The revolutionary physicist used his imagination rather than fancy math to come up with his most famous and elegant equation.
Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity is famous for predicting some really weird but true phenomena, like astronauts aging slower than people on Earth and solid objects changing their shapes at high speeds.But the thing is, if you pick up a copy of Einstein’s original paper on relativity from 1905, it’s a straightforward read.

      <h3>The Orion Nebula</h3>
        <aside>     
      <img src="images/orion_nebula.jpg"></aside> 


    <article><p>The nebula is an enormous cloud of dust and gas where vast numbers of new stars are being forged. Its bright, central region is the home of four massive, young stars that shape the nebula. The four hefty stars are called the Trapezium because they are arranged in a trapezoidal pattern. Ultraviolet light unleashed by these stars is carving a cavity in the nebula and disrupting the growth of hundreds of smaller stars.

        <h3>Black Holes</h3>
      
        <aside>  <img src="images/black_hole.jpg"></aside> 
      <article> <p>A black hole has a gravitational pull is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape it once inside a certain region called the event horizon. As gas and dust (or even entire stars) are sucked in, the material is accelerated and heated to very high temperatures. This in turn results in the emission of X-ray light. Black holes containing lots of nearby gas and dust, such as this black hole at the center of the M81 galaxy, produce tremendous amounts of X-ray light.<a href="black_holes.html">Read More</a></p>

        <h3>String Theory</h3>

      <article> <p>  Is String Theory the final solution for all of physic’s questions or an overhyped dead end?

  This video was realised with the help of Dr. Alessandro Sfondrini and it was funded by SNSF under Agora Grant.<a href="string.html">Read More</a></p>
