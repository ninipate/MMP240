      <h3>The Orion Nebula</h3>
        <aside>     
      <img src="images/orion_nebula.jpg"></aside> 


    <article><p>The nebula is an enormous cloud of dust and gas where vast numbers of new stars are being forged. Its bright, central region is the home of four massive, young stars that shape the nebula. The four hefty stars are called the Trapezium because they are arranged in a trapezoidal pattern. Ultraviolet light unleashed by these stars is carving a cavity in the nebula and disrupting the growth of hundreds of smaller stars.

       <h2>Neuetron Stars</h2>
         <aside>  <img src="images/neutron_star.jpg"></aside> 
      
       <article> <p>When the core of a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse at the end of its life, protons and electrons are literally scrunched together, leaving behind one of nature's most wondrous creations: a neutron star. Neutron stars cram roughly 1.3 to 2.5 solar masses into a city-sized sphere perhaps 20 kilometers (12 miles) across. Matter is packed so tightly that a sugar-cube-sized amount of material would weigh more than 1 billion tons, about the same as Mount Everest!

        <h3>Black Holes</h3>
      
        <aside>  <img src="images/black_hole.jpg"></aside> 
      <article> <p>A black hole has a gravitational pull is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape it once inside a certain region called the event horizon. As gas and dust (or even entire stars) are sucked in, the material is accelerated and heated to very high temperatures. This in turn results in the emission of X-ray light. Black holes containing lots of nearby gas and dust, such as this black hole at the center of the M81 galaxy, produce tremendous amounts of X-ray light.<a href="black_holes.html">Read More</a></p>
