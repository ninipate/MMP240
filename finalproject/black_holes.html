   <img src="images/black_hole.jpg">A black hole has a gravitational pull is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape it once inside a certain region called the event horizon. As gas and dust (or even entire stars) are sucked in, the material is accelerated and heated to very high temperatures. This in turn results in the emission of X-ray light. Black holes containing lots of nearby gas and dust, such as this black hole at the center of the M81 galaxy, produce tremendous amounts of X-ray light.
</p>  

<p>
But black holes are messy eaters. Some of the material swirling into the black hole doesn't fall in but rather is spit out at nearly the speed of light. This material is caught up in powerful magnetic fields  the black hole. These "jets" not only shoot some material away, they also emit prolific amounts of energy from radio waves to visible light to X-ray light. The jets of material shooting out from the central black hole of the Perseus cluster have blown out large holes (cavities) in the nearby gaseous medium and - like waves propagating on a pond surface - have set up ripples throughout the entire cluster medium. These ripples are the sound waves.</p> 


<ul>There are three types of black holes, and they form in different ways:
  <li>Primordial black holes -- as small as an atom, perhaps, with the mass of a large mountain -- are thought to have formed in the early universe, soon after the Big Bang.                  </li>
<li> Stellar black holes, like the one pictured above, form when the center of a very massive star collapses in upon itself.                 </li>
<li> Supermassive black holes formed at the same time as the galaxy they are in, scientists believe; the size of the supermassive black hole is related to the size and mass of the galaxy it is in.                </li>

</ul>
