-don't judge = you never know what the person is going thru , so don't judge them. ; Also you never know if you will one day do the same with different circumstances.;
-mind your own business = don't try to dig into other peoples personal lives, don't look at how they act or how they feel
-be yourself = don't worry about how you will look in other peoples eyes, don;t try to copy others in any way (unles you see a cool outfit idea- then u copy that for sure)
-last but not least WEAR DARK SUNGLASSES everywhere you go. It doesnt even has to be sunny, U will see how everyone be starting at you even inside the subway.Glasses do magic ! everyone will know you know you are cool(u think u are cool)</article>
