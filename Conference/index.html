 <h1>>Reentry/Entry Symposium: Pedagogy, Programs, and Policies that Support and Sustain Justice-Involved CUNY Students</h1> 
<h2>
Friday, May 3rd, 2019 at Borough of Manhattan Community College, Fiterman Hall (245 Greenwich Street) 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM</h2>
The City University of New York--which welcomes all comers and has always been a “portal of opportunity” for New Yorkers—has emerged as a national leader in educating justice-involved students.   By welcoming and supporting justice-involved students into our institutions we open doors to education and economic opportunity. CUNY scholars, CUNY program staff and administrators, reentry experts from Community Based Organizations (CBOs), as well as justice-involved students and alums, will share research, best practices, knowledge and experiences.  In so doing, we can reduce barriers, transform programs, coordinate efforts, and deepen productive relationships—all in an effort to diminish stigma, and promote equity and inclusion for justice-involved students in higher education and beyond. 
SPACE IS LIMITED. REGISTER BY CLICKING HERE, NO LATER THAN APRIL 15TH
