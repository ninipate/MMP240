            <p>“I amsterdam” is Amsterdam’s hugely successful marketing slogan.
Yes, a capital ‘I’ and a lower caps ‘a’.
And no, there is no ‘I  amsterdam’ or ‘I love Amsterdam’ sign.</p>
            <p>The main set of letters used to be located at the back of the Rijksmuseum, the Netherlands’ premier art museum — just a stone throw from the Van Gogh Museum (which houses the largest collection of paintings by Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) in the world).
 Amsterdam Marketing happily estimates the letters are photographed some 6.000 times a day. ‘Happily,’ because the original intention — marketing Amsterdam abroad in the wake of the financial crisis — has worked far beyond expectation.

In fact, now that (according to a growing number of locals) Amsterdam is “overrun” with tourists, many Amsterdammers believe the sign has worked too well, and has overstayed its welcome.1

The marketing folks, meanwhile, have changed their focus from attracting tourists to promoting the city as an ideal place to do business, organize international conferences and congresses, and locate or relocate company headquarters or satellite offices.
Hopefully the letters will be back on it's place soon enough.
